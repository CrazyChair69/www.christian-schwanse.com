On the website I present myself, my skills, professional experience and projects.<br />
The portfolio website itself is also a project.<br />
<br />
<br />

## General Information about the Project
- Client: Myself
- Project Goal: Demonstrate my skills, professional experience, projects and learn frontend web development without a framework.

## How I worked on this project
Planning at the beginning. Answering questions such as:
- How do I want to implement the website?
- What scope should the project have - taking into account that I work and have other commitments?
- Which pages and content should the website contain?
- Who should the website be aimed at and how should it be accessible / findable (e.g. marketing)?
<br />

Once the planning was complete, it was time to get down to business - a cycle consisting of the following steps:
- Planning a work step for a new functionality
- Programming
- Testing
- If successful: Code Refactoring. If failed: Bug Fixing
- Testing
- Github Commit / Push
<br />

As a final step, the website was fine-tuned: mobile responsiveness, code refactoring,
user-friendliness and SEO.
<br />
<br />

## Why I implemented the project in this way
I developed this website without a framework - just the lovely triangle: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
<br />
Reason: It's my first real, self-programmed website. I'm generally a fan of practicing the basics first before venturing into new, "interesting" things.
<br />
I also had the thought that I would clearly see the advantages and compromises of frameworks in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## My 3 most important points that I have learned from this project
1. Create your own components such as headers or footers that can be  can be reused across pages.
2. Mobile responsiveness. I thought it would be done with Flexbox and Grid - I was very wrong. I had to adapt the design in various places so that it looks good on small, medium-sized and extra-extra-large screens. The testing alone was time-consuming enough.
3. It is very time-consuming to develop a website (including content) from scratch. Figma would make sense in the long term. A tool for designers and developers to create prototypes of UIs. This avoids the case of programming something for a long time and then discarding it in the end because you don't like it after all - I'd rather not say whether this happened to me during the project ðŸ˜‰ Todo management software such as Jira is also helpful.

I look forward to you visiting my website and having a look around!
