<br />
A portfolio website where I present myself and my projects.<br />
<br />
The website itself is a portfolio project.<br />
Built from scratch - **No** framework or CMS such as WordPress was used.<br />
Only the dear triangle: HTML, CSS and JavaScript ðŸ˜‰.<br />
<br />
To be honest: Sometimes, it's really painful.<br />
But I wanted to learn a lot.<br />
I don't regret it one bit!<br />
<br />
Enjoy it!<br />
<br />
<br />
Greetings

Chris
