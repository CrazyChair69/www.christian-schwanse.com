A portfolio website where I present myself and my projects.

The website itself is a portfolio project.
Built from scratch - **No** framework or CMS such as WordPress was used.
Only the dear triangle: HTML, CSS and JavaScript ðŸ˜‰.

To be honest: It's painful.
But I wanted to learn a lot!
I don't regret it one bit.

Enjoy it!


Greetings

Chris
