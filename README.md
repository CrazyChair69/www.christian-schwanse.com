A portfolio website where I present myself and my projects.

The website itself is a portfolio project.<br>
Built from scratch - **No** framework or CMS such as WordPress was used.<br>
Only the dear triangle: HTML, CSS and JavaScript ðŸ˜‰.<br>

To be honest: It's painful.<br>
But I wanted to learn a lot!<br>
I don't regret it one bit.<br>

Enjoy it!


Greetings

Chris
