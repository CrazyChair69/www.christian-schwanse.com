                        <p>
                            I first came into contact with SAP during my training as an IT specialist for application
                            development.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I was skeptical at first, but now I'm a big fan of SAP! Thanks to my previous knowledge of
                            computer science, I was able to get to grips with ABAP and other technologies very quickly.

                        <details class="details1-sub-details">
                            <summary>Procedural ABAP</summary>
                            <p>
                                My daily work (e.g. reports or interfaces) includes dealing with function modules, form
                                routines or similar.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I myself am a proponent of ABAP OO. Due to legacy code, the procedural ABAP programming
                                model is also part of my repertoire.
                            </p>
                        </details>

                        <details class="details1-sub-details">
                            <summary>ABAP OO</summary>
                            <p>
                                My favorite ABAP programming model is <u>definitely</u> ABAP OO. It offers many
                                advantages over procedural programming if you do it right. It is my first choice for new
                                developments or existing OO developments.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The foundation for object orientation in ABAP was laid by the certificates from the
                                Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences (&ldquor;ABAP for advanced users&ldquo;) and
                                from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (&ldquor;Computational Thinking using
                                Python&ldquo;).
                            </p>

                            <summary>Dynamic Programming</summary>
                            <p>
                                Dynamic programming can seem very scary at first glance. Terms like RTTS, RTTI, RTTC as
                                well as arrows, stars and the good old Elvis Presley operator (?=) are thrown at you. I
                                have to say, I'm now a big fan of it!
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Dynamic programming can be used to create very elegant, scalable solutions, when, for
                                example, the basic procedure is the same, but the inputs and outputs can be very
                                different and changeable.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Instead of having to program something 20 - 30 times, just once can be enough! And with
                                good error handling, the program can also be robust and easy to debug.

                                I had to deal with Dynpro programming both at work and in the ABAP training course at TH
                                Brandenburg. Terms like PBO, PAI or Screen Painter are part of my vocabulary.

                            <p>
                                Admittedly, the technology (as well as Web Dynpro) does not come close to front-end web
                                development with e.g. Flexbox or Grid layout.
                            </p>

                                It still fulfills its purpose for reports or more complex applications.

                                I mainly created the reports with the new ALV display (class

                                Formerly programmed with the ABAP Workbench. Tried ABAP Eclipse - love at first sight.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                ABAP Eclipse is more in line with modern development environments and offers numerous
                                additional functions such as better code refactoring, code editor views, several
                                workspaces and an infinite number of SAP tabs (*Finally no more annoying pop-ups!* 😄).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Eclipse also forgives internet crashes. In SAP this is the worst case scenario...

                            <p>
                                However, I personally find debugging in the ABAP Workbench more convenient.

                            <p>
                                I had my first contact with Web Dynpros in the course &ldquor;ABAP for advanced
                                learners&ldquo; of the Brandenburg University of Applied Sciences (see section
                                &ldquor;Certificates&ldquo; for more information).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For example, the Web Dynpro architecture (MVC pattern) and the components (contexts,
                                windows, inbound/outbound plugs, ...) were explained there.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However, I haven't had anything to do with this in the private sector. In my opinion,
                                this is also outdated technology and has been replaced by SAP Fiori.

                                The database language SQL was part of the course content at the vocational school for

                                In smaller leisure projects, a CRUD (= Create, Read, Update, Delete) was also often
                                necessary.

                                The SAP language ABAP also has a lot in common with SQL.

                                I am a big fan of ticket systems. It makes it much easier to communicate and document
                                problems &amp; requests with customers as well as my own colleagues &amp; superiors.

                                I like to compare Git or Github with old Pokemon games on the Nintendo Gameboy or DS: If
                                you play for several hours and the game suddenly hangs, the entire savegame is lost. Or
                                you miss catching a rare or legendary Pokemon.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You can reduce the possible loss of game states by saving them temporarily. Or you can
                                do a reset at a certain time to get another chance to catch a rare or legendary Pokemon.

                                And that's exactly why I love Git or Github: It allows you to &ldquor;cache&ldquo; code
                                and reset it if you mess something up or something not yet allowed into the production
                                system.

                                I find it very interesting how people perceive the world, communicate with each other
                                and form their identities over the course of their lives. How hormones and our situation
                                influence our thoughts, feelings and actions, both consciously and unconsciously.
                            </p>

                                That was also one of the reasons why I started studying business psychology.

                                One of my favorite concepts is &ldquor;nudging&ldquo;. You change small things in your
                                environment / situation and thereby have a big influence on your own or other people's
                                actions. The concept can be applied in all areas of life.

                            <p>
                                Example: You want to lose weight. Nudging action: Remove all unhealthy foods in the
                                household. Result: You automatically eat less unhealthy food. Less discipline is needed
                                to resist daily temptations.

                            After the second time I dropped out of university, I realized that studying was not for me.
                            I need practical relevance. I like to learn a lot if I know that I can use it for the
                            future.

                            Or if I learn it out of my own desire. In university, it's too broad or it doesn't make
                            sense why you should learn a particular subject. The gap between theory and practice can be
                            very wide.

                                Code should be written in such a way that it is intuitively understandable. The
                                advantages of clean code are more stable and easily maintainable programs. This in turn
                                means fewer bugs, less maintenance work and less stress. 😉

                            I spent a lot of my childhood and youth playing video games. Whether it was Pokemon, Mario,

                            friends.

                            It wasn't until my mid-20s that I discovered my enthusiasm for traveling &amp; hiking. One
